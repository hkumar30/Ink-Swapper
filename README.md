## Add your own colours!
Instructions:

1) Add your colour name using the `elif` statement inside the `ink_swap` function.

2) Add the respective RGB values of your desired colour inside the `elif` function to add your colour to the database.

3) Optional: Add the following line — `colour != <your colour>` on Line 55 to remove the following text in Output:
  > Your choice is not present in our database.
  
  > Switching to Blue-Black Ink instead.
  
This will completely register your colour in the database.
